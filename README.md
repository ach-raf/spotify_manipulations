# spotify_manipulations

- Interact with spotify API more easily.

- A python script with funcitons to help you manipulate spotify easily.

# Requirements:
- Python 3
- pip

# Installation:

- Clone or donwload the repository to a directory of your choice.
- ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

# Usage:

- You will need from the [spotify developer console](https://developer.spotify.com/console/), your username, client_id and secret.

- Edit spotify_credentials.ini with your spotify username, client_id, and secret.

- When you run the script for the first time, a localhost tab will open to authenticate you to spotify, you need to copy that link and past it in your terminal.

- After that, a cache for your login will be created, so you can use the script as you wish afterwards.

# To Note:
- My function to save to a playlist can avoid the 100 requests limit by spotify, so you can add as many tracks as you want. 

- I created a function to import your shazam CSV to a spotify playlist.
