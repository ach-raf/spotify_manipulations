# spotify_manipulations

Interact with spotify API more easily.

A python script with funcitons to help you manipulate spotify easily.

# Usage:

Edit spotify_credentials.ini with your spotify username, client id, and secret.

When you run the script for the first time, a localhost tab will open to authenticate you to spotify, you need to copy that link and past it in your terminal.

After that, a cache for your login will be created, so you can use the script as you wish afterwards.

# To Note:
- My function to save to a playlist can avoid the 100 requests limit by spotify, so you can add as many tracks as you want. 

- I created a function to import your shazam CSV to a spotify playlist.
